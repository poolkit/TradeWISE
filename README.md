This privacy policy describes how we treat personal information and data when you use TradeWise.
In this privacy policy, we'd like to describe what kind of data we may collect from you in connection with your use of our services and how we may use such data. Below we call these collectively "Services". By using our Services, you agree to the processing of your data in accordance with this privacy policy.
We may amend this privacy policy from time to time by posting a new version online so please review it frequently. Your continued use of our Services after posting of a new version is deemed as your acceptance of the modified terms.

**Personal Information** : <br>
TradeWise does not collect any personal information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.). Further, it does not collect or report back to us (or anyone else) any data regarding your computer keystrokes or other data unrelated to the services the Extension provides.
When installing the TradeWise extension on a personal Google account we are provided with no information regarding who has completed the installation.
We only use the OpenAI API key, which will be needed to make LLM calls to OpenAI, and the current URL, to verify and send as a request parameter.
This privacy policy contains no section on the sharing of personal information because we have none to share.

**Data** :<br>
TradeWise uses Chrome's local storage to store the API key. This key will remain offline and will be local to each machine.

**External Links** :<br>
TradeWise leverages an external backend server to seamlessly interact with APIs, enabling it to retrieve summaries by sending the current URL as a request parameter.
